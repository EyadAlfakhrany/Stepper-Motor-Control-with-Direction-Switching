# Stepper Motor Control with Direction Switching

This project demonstrates how to control a stepper motor using an AVR microcontroller. The motor alternates between clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) directions in an infinite loop. Additionally, an LED is activated to indicate the system is running.

## Project Name

**Analysis and Control of a Standalone Synchronous Generator Driven by Wind**  
(submodule: Stepper Motor Control System)

---

## Description

This is a sub-project developed as part of a larger system for wind-driven standalone synchronous generator analysis and control.  
Here, we focus on stepper motor control logic which could be used to adjust physical parameters (e.g., capacitor bank switching, blade angle adjustment, etc.).
