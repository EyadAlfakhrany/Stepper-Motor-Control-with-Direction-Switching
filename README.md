# Stepper-Motor-Control-with-Direction-Switching
his project demonstrates the basic control of a stepper motor using an AVR microcontroller. The motor continuously alternates between clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, and a status LED is turned on to indicate operation. This setup is useful for testing basic motor control logic and driver integration.
